### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vadzim Fiadotsyeu, I'm a senior software testing engineer at EPAM, performing manual and automated QA work in ecomm. 

Apart from, well, work, I actively participate in HOI4 modding scene as a hobby, with main contibutions targeting:
- [Kaiserreich](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1521695605) (Paradox Scripting Language) - One of the most popular modifications for Hearts of Iron IV;
- [CWTools - Hoi4 config](https://github.com/cwtools/cwtools-hoi4-config) - CWTools .cwt config files for Hearts of Iron IV - static code analysis tool for pdx modders;

My personal repos include various coding projects in Python:
- Testing suite for Kaiserreich with around 100 integration and unit tests to check various aspects of the codebase to keep our product quality high. Execution via pytest, supports Jenkins as runner. Fast execution, widespread code reusage and easy maintenance thanks to OOP;
- Code formatter for Kaiserreich
- Data gathering and processing pipeline for Kaiserreich
