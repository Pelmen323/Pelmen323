### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vadzim Fiadotsyeu, I'm from Belarus, and I'm working as a software testing engineer at EPAM.

In my free time I am a developer for [Kaiserreich](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1521695605)

I'm a big fan of Python coding and I am eager to use the power of programming in software testing.
What can you find on this page? Various Repos with tests in Python:
- UI automation demos via Selenium
- API automation demos via requests lib
- A set of tests for Kaiserreich - this one is in active development and is constantly expanding, It can be used with Jenkins as well!
- A repo with various programs in Python written by me as practice
