### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vadzim Fiadotsyeu, I'm from Belarus, and I'm working as a software testing engineer at EPAM.

In my free time I am a developer for [Kaiserreich](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1521695605)

I'm a big fan of Python coding and I am eager to use the power of programming in software testing.
What can you find on this page? Various Repos with tests in Python:
- A set of tests for Kaiserreich with more than 80 tests to check various aspects of the codebase to keep our product quality high. Execution via pytest, supports Jenkins as runner;
- UI test automation demos via Selenium;
- API test automation demos via requests lib;
- A repo with various small programs in Python;
